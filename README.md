# Note Taker 3000

## Description

I created the server.js file in order to practice and better understand how the front-end interacts with the back-end. This app also could help anyone take and have a space to organize notes.

## Installation

The only package that needs to be installed is express. There is no further installation required.

## Usage

This is where the GIF would go. I might consider using another option then a straight GIF.

I also will need to see how the front-end interacts, so I can give some detail on that bc that is how the app will work.

## Credits

Although I did not use any direct code or tutorials on any specific instance, I would like to give a shot out to Web Dev Simplified's general [express.js tutorial](https://youtu.be/SccSCuHhOw0).
